# Hermes Health Patient Upload & Site Sonar Script
# ------------------------------------------------
# This script demonstrates how to:
# 1. Add a patient to a project on Hermes Health.
# 2. Upload the patientâ€™s HIPAA authorization PDF.
# 3. Trigger Site Sonar to discover facilities tied to the patient.
# 4. Print out facility metadata returned by the API.
